## Scenario
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

## Inventory Management System
This is an app that allows the user to add, modify, and delete parts and products from an inventory database.
